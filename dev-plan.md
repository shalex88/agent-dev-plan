2. **Implement incrementally**: Build features in phases as outlined in section 7, ensuring each phase is complete before moving to the next.

3. **Follow coding standards**: Adhere to the coding standards specified in section 6.2 throughout development.

4. **Test continuously**: Write unit tests alongside implementation code, aiming for the coverage targets specified.

5. **Document as you go**: Add inline documentation and update architectural documentation with any design changes.

### 12.2 Key Checkpoints

Before proceeding to the next phase, ensure:

- [ ] All deliverables from the current phase are complete
- [ ] All acceptance criteria are met
- [ ] Code review has been completed (simulate this with code quality checks)
- [ ] Tests are passing and coverage targets are met

### 12.3 Adaptation Guidelines
