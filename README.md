1. Initial prompt for creating Product Requirements Document (PRD)

    ```bash
    Help me create a Product Requirements Document (PRD) as prd.md file. Here what we're building:
    [Overview]

    The tech stack I know I will use is:
    * [Tech Stack 1]
    * [Tech Stack 2]

    These are the features I want to include:
    * [Feature 1]
    * [Feature 2]

    I'm building this with an AI agent, I don't need any team milestones, timelines or anything like that.
    Ask me if you have any questions for clarification, and continue to write PRD.
    ```

2. Prompt for passing PRD to AI agent

    ```bash
    ```
