Prepare a working plan, don't proceed to coding without me approving it

When the plan is approved create a todo.md with the tasks to be executed

The project should be self-contained and buildable from the root directory without manual intervention

Add a header comment to each generated file: 'AI-generated'

Prepare build system before coding

For C++ projects use [C++ Guidelines](instructions/cpp.instructions.md)

For Rust projects use [Rust Guidelines](instructions/rust.instructions.md)
