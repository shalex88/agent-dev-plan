Prepare a working plan, don't proceed to coding without me approving it

Ask me if you need any clarifications or additional information before proceeding

The project should be self-contained and buildable from the root directory without manual intervention

Add a header comment to each generated file: 'AI-generated'

Prepare build system before coding
